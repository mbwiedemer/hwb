		<h2 class="news">Apple seeds Carrollton growth facility</h2>
        <p class="author">By Janet Peavy</p>

        <p class="paper">With the speed of a picker anticipating a hail storm, Apple Computer Inc. shook a few branches in Carrollton in early July, and only a week later dropped its 1st fruit — mini computers in pristine condition.</p>
		<p class="paper">The whirlwind start of what is destined to be apple’s major manufacturing facility seems typical of the storybook company, only four years old, a $150-million toddler with a speed of a track star.</p>
		<p class="paper">From its origins in a California garage, the product of two college drop outs who financed their start by selling a VW bus and a programmable calculator for $1300, Apple has already burst out of its Cupertino, California, manufacturing plant and come to Carrollton to grow some more.</p>
		<p class="paper">Plant manager, Andy Prachick, one of the 20-person management team hired in one day of intensive interviewing a few months ago is excited about his new job.</p>
		<p class="paper">“We have 150,000 square feet here,” he said, gazing around the facility, which looked more vast for its still large, empty spaces, “and I fully intend to fill every square foot of it.”</p>
		<p class="paper">He and his team have already made a good start.</p>
		
		
		<p class="paper">Arriving on site, July 3, they received their first working materials on July 7. By July 11, electronic equipment, work benches, conveyors, and other paraphernalia were not only set up and operating, but the first Apple had rolled off the line, fully checked and ready to compute. </p>

		<p class="paper">On July 15, City of, Carrollton and Chamber of Commerce officials helped Apple officials cut the ribbon on the new establishment. The first apple produced in the plant was labeled and gold and presented ceremoniously to the companies chairman of the board A.C. “Mike” Markkula, the financial wizard who has steered the business end of the young corporation from its beginnings.</p>
		
		<p class="paper">“The two of them  (Apple’s cofounder Steven jobs, now only 25, and Stephen Wozniak, 28), made a very wise decision and going with him,” set, Prachick, after only a few months already immersed in Apple’s brief but colorful history.</p>
		<p class="paper">Long on talent and short on business sense, the two inventors turned to Markkula, who had already retired at the age of 30 to manage his investment portfolio, was bored, and ultimately was filled with excitement by the prospects of Apple and the mini computer industry.</p>
		<p class="paper">The company’s major product today is the Apple II, originally build as a hobbyist computer, but sophisticated enough for many professional, business and educational purposes. It’s  uses range from a plaything for kids and adults to the running a small businesses.</p>
		<p class="paper">The Carrollton facility will be producing all of the companies Apple IIs by the end of the summer and shortly thereafter will be the sole manufacturing site for the popular machine.</p>
		<p class="paper">The Apple III, the company’s entry in the lucrative business market for small computers, has already taken off strongly since it’s introduction in October, and is credited with the spur to move to Texas.</p>
		<p class="paper">“The introduction of the Apple III at the recent National Computer Convention in California, actually forced this building (in Carrollton) into existence,” Prachick said.</p>
		<p class="paper">Eventually, all Apple III production will also be moved to Carrollton, making it the corporation’s major manufacturing facility. Still in California will be the company’s research, engineering and development divisions. Once a product is brought to maturity, it will probably be produced here, the plant manager said.</p>
		<p class="paper">In addition to the computer lines, the Carrollton plant is producing some Apple components, including the floppy disk drives.</p>
		<p class="paper">Prachick is proud that almost all his management team and employees were culled right in the Dallas area.</p>

		<p class="paper">“We’ve got the best bunch of people imaginable, fantastic for a facility just starting out, the cream of the crop,” he enthused.  He added that he intends to keep hiring here as the plant capacity grows.</p>
		<p class="paper">“Apple came to this area because of the local electronic growth in the Southwest — the TIs, the Tandy’s, the Mosteks,” he said. “Not only do we have easy sources of components, but there are people here who understand computers.”</p>
		<p class="paper">There are also, he said, with relish, competitors. “We’re going to take ‘em on toe to toe.“</p>
		<p class="paper">Apple is currently No. 2 in the home computer field, second to Tandy’s TRS 80, which is marked by Tandy subsidiary Radio Shack. However, Apple ranks on top among those companies originally formed to make home computers — a field which has had a number of dropouts in bankruptcies in recent months.</p>
		<p class="paper">Prachick is not loathe to admit the company has drawn employees from most of its major competitors in the area.</p>
		<p class="paper">“We’re growing so fast we don’t have time to grow people internally,“ he said. “Apple’s philosophy is to get out and hire the best people we can — hire expertise and pay for it. We don’t have much time for training.”</p>
		<p class="paper">Already the 70-person production crew at the plant has outstripped its available materials and watches the loading doors anxiously for the next consignment from California. When the plant is in full swing — within the next few weeks, said Prachick, the demand for employees, particularly skilled assemblers, will be increasing “off and on for quite a while.”</p>
